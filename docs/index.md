# Tutorial: cat-dog-classification-tflite-flutter

This Flutter project classifies images as either **cat** or _dog_ using a pre-trained TFLite model. The app allows users to select an image from their device, and then uses the model to predict whether the image contains a cat or a dog. It uses the `tflite_flutter` and `tflite_flutter_helper` packages to interact with the model and pre-process/post-process the images. The model itself is stored as an asset within the app.
